Hello! I'm Jose Enrique Zaragoza, known for PepeQuique.

I'm currently in my 4rd semester studying Business Digital Transformation Engineering at the Tecnológico de Monterrey.

My main interests lie in technological development within businesses, programming. I'm a nature enthusiast and a fan of all sports involving mountains and adventures!

I primarily work with Python, C++, and R, but I'm eager to continue learning any programming languages necessary for progress.

I'm interested in collaborating on projects for businesses and identifying their needs to provide technological solutions.
